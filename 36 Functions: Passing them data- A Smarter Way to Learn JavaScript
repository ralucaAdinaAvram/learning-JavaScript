!  When there are multiple arguments and parameters, the arguments and parameters are matched up by their order


=======   Exercise 1     ======= 
Code the first line of a function named concat that has 3 parameters, the first three letters of the alphabet.
=======    Solution     ========
function concat (a,b,c) {




=======   Exercise 2     ======= 
Code a function that takes a variable, a string, and a number as arguments
=======    Solution     ========
makeAddress (city, "Two", 3);


=======   Exercise 3     ======= 
Code the first line of a function that has 2 parameters
=======    Solution     ========
function combineNames( firstName, lastName){



=======   Exercise 4     ======= 
Code a function that has 2 parameters. Concatenate them and assign the result to a variable that hasn't been declared beforehand.
=======    Solution     ========
function concat( string1, string2) {
var combo= string1 + string2;
}


=======   Exercise  5    ======= 
Code a function that has three parameters. Multiply them and assign them to a variable that hasn't been declared yet.
=======    Solution     ========
function mult(a,b,c){
var num = a * b* c;
}



=======   Exercise 6     ======= 
Code a call to x, with the first three letters of teh alphabet being variables that serve as arguments.
=======    Solution     ========
x(a, b, c);




=======   Exercise 7      ======= 
Code the first line of a function that has 3 parameters.
On the next line code the statement that calls the function, with 3 different variables used as arguments.
(For example, if the parameters are a, b, and c, the arguments might be d, e, and f.) Don't indent the second line.
=======    Solution     ========
function do Something(a, b, c){
doSomething(d, e, f);



=======   Exercise  8    ======= 
Code a function with 1 parameter that does nothing, and call it, specifying a variable as the argument.
=======    Solution     ========
function doNothing(param1) {
}
doNothing(arg1);




=======   Exercise 9     ======= 
Code a function that has three parameters. Multiply them and assign them to a variable that hasn't been declared yet.
=======    Solution     ========
function mult(a, b, c) {
  var num = a * b * c;
}



=======   Exercise 10     ======= 
I've coded the call to the function that displays the alert. Code the function. Leave my code as-is. 
var part1 = "The medium ";
var part2 = "is the message.";
displayIdiom(part1, part2);
=======    Solution     ========
var part1 = "The medium ";
var part2 = "is the message.";
displayIdiom(part1, part2);
function displayIdiom(part1, part2) {alert (part1 + part2);
}




=======   Exercise 11     ======= 
Code a function with 2 number parameters. Sum them and assign the sum to a variable. 
The function displays an alert concatenating "The sum is " with the variable. Code the function call.
=======    Solution     ========
function numTot(num2, num4) {
var sum2 = num2 + num4;
alert( "The sum is " + sum2);
}
numTot(2, 4);
